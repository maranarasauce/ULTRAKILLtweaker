ULTRAKILLtweaker is a mod for Ultrakill that lets you tweak various things.

# Installation Instructions
1. Follow the Bepinex tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meNiXcbPh_s), up until 1:10
2. Unzip the [UMM.zip](https://github.com/Temperz87/ultra-mod-manager/releases/) file into ULTRAKILL\BepInEx. Make sure you are using release 0.4 or later. Do not use 'Recompile for ACT-2 release', it may appear at the top but it is not the newest.

5. Open the game, click the mods button, click on ULTRAKILLtweaker so it is green and tick the box so it is crossed.
