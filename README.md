# Installation Instructions
You should probably watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h61ZGZp7A44) tutorial by nptnk.
If you don't want to though, here are instructions in text.

1. Follow the Bepinex tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meNiXcbPh_s), up until 1:10
2. Unzip the [UMM.zip](https://github.com/Temperz87/ultra-mod-manager/releases/) file into ULTRAKILL\BepInEx. Make sure you are using release 0.4 or later. Do not use 'Recompile for ACT-2 release', it may appear at the top but it is not the newest.
3. Go to ULTRAKILL\BepInEx\UMM Mods and delete CustomArms.dll (unless you want the custom arms).
4. Download a [release](https://github.com/wafflethings/ULTRAKILLtweaker/releases) and unzip it into the ULTRAKILL folder.
5. Open the game, click the mods button, click on ULTRAKILLtweaker so it is green and tick the box so it is crossed.
